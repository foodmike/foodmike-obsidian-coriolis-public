# Group Notes and Info for Coriolis

This respository of files contains basic info to get going in Coriolis. You should start by reading the [Character Creation](./CharacterCreation.pdf) doc. Then take a look at the [Concept Descriptions](ConceptDescriptions.pdf). 

The [Concepts Chart](Concepts.pdf) has each Concept, their sub-concepts, and what each one's key skills are. This gives you an idea of the primary capabilities of each Concept.

The [Skills](Skills.pdf) table shows all the skills, grouped by General/Advanced.

The [Quickstart Guide](CoriolisQuickstart.pdf) is the basic rules. These are available from free from the Free League website, but I thought I'd put them here for convenience. You don't have to read this, but obviously you can if you want.

Here is a [Character Sheet](CharacterSheet.pdf) if you'd like to look at one.
