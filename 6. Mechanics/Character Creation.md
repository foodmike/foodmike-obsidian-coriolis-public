## Background
Origin means both which star system you come from, and whether you’re of the Firstcome or a Zenithian. An important part of the Third Horizon’s history is the two waves of colo- nization that have swept across the systems. The Firstcome have been living in the Horizon for hundreds of years, but have been isolated from each other for a long time. The Zenithians are newcomers who have opened up the trade routes and furthered contact between the systems once again. Roll to determine your home planet on table 2.1 on the next page. Your origin has no mechanical effect; it merely tells you something about who your PC is.

## Choose a Concept
See the list of [[Concepts]]. Note that it would probably be useful to have someone with [[6. Mechanics/Skills/Pilot|Pilot]] and someone with [[Medicurgy]]. Keep in mind that advanced skills require at least 1 level in the skill.

Total points depends on your [[Character Creation#Upbringing|Upbringing]]. [[Concept]] skills have **max of 3**. Other skills have **max of 1**.

## Talents
Talents are tricks, cheats and abilities that give you an edge over others. They are more specialized than skills, and are a way to give further detail to your PC. Talents are described in Chapter 4.

You will have three talents at the start of the game – one each from your group concept, your character concept, and your Icon. You can acquire more talents during play. Mystical powers are a special category of talents – they are only available to a PC with at least skill level 1 in the Mystic Powers skill. If you begin play as a Mystic, you get to choose one free mystical power talent.

## Your Icon and Icon Talent
The nine Icons are ever-present in the Third Horizon. Almost all believe in their power, and the protection they offer from the Dark between the Stars. Prayers, giving alms and the burning of incense are common among most people at the start of a long journey, before signing a business contract or just to jump-start the old harvester in the shed.

You are born under the sign of one of the Icons. This Icon will have a tangible impact on your life, and might just lend you supernatural powers. You won’t get to choose your Icon – this is up to fate. Your icon will determine your [[Icon Talents|Icon Talent]].

| D66   | Icon              |
| ----- | ----------------- |
| 11-14 | The Lady of Tears |
| 15-22 | The Dancer        |
| 23-26 | The Gambler       |
| 31-34 | The Merchant      |
| 35-42 | The Deckhand      |
| 43-46 | The Traveler      |
| 51-54 | The Messenger     |
| 55-62 | The Judge         |
| 63-66 | The Faceless      |

## Personal Problem
See your [[Concept]]

## Relationships
Describe your relationship to each of the other PCs with a short sentence on your character sheet. Your concept lists a few suggestions to choose from, or to use as inspiration.

	### PC Buddy
	Pick one PC as your buddy – your best friend in the group. Check the box next to that person on your character sheet.

## Gear
Your [[Concept]] gives you a few choices. You can purchase extra [[Weapons and Gear|Gear]] during play.

**Starting Capital**: The currency in the Third Horizon is called the birr. Your [[Character Creation#Upbringing|upringing]] determines how many birr you start the game with, along with your starting gear. Transactions involving birr are mostly handled electronically, using  tags.

## Encumbrance
You can carry a number of items equal to your Strength doubled. Note down one object per row on your character sheet. [[Icon Talents]] can increase your carrying capacity.

- Heavy Objects: 2 rows on character sheet.
- Light Objects: 1/2 row on character sheet.
- Tiny Objects: Do not effect encumbrance. Still must write down.
- Overencumbered: You can temporarily carry more than your normal load. If you do though, you must roll the [[Force]] skill each time you attempt to move any long distance. If you fail the roll you must either let go of what you are carrying, or stop where you are.
