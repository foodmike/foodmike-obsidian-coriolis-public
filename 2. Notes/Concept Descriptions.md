### Artist
The Icons live through poetry, songs and books. You have dedicated your life to the fleeting moments of Iconic beauty that your art creates. You know that no culture is stronger than its art, and you intend to make sure the Third Horizon is remembered for something other than chaos, war and destruction.

### Data Spider
The factions rule the Horizon, and information guides their actions. If you can control this information, you will be powerful. A simple enough equation, but you are one of the few to have figured it out. You are a Data Spider, carefully weaving a complex net of data gathered from the most obscure sources. You might not be the sharpest dressed or have a single birr to your name, but you have information, and information is power.

### Fugitive
You can never stop moving. Always look over your shoulder. Always sleep with a gun under your pillow. You are on the run from the past. It doesn’t matter what you once may or may not have done – all that matters is getting to the next hideout, the next safe haven. But some day you shall be rid of your pursuers. Some day you will dare sleep with your back to the door.

### Negotiator
Words are what keep the Horizon running. Weapons and threats may have their uses, but in the end, it’s around the negotiating table where everything is really settled. You have realized this, and seen the immense power that lies in closing a deal when all hope seems lost. Your sharp intellect and silver tongue can move mountains.

### Operative
You are a professional. You move unnoticed through the shadows, as comfortable in a crowded bazaar as in the corridors of power. Where law and diplomacy end, you begin. You are an Operative, the long arm of the powerful, carrying out missions in the dark. You expect neither laurels nor fame. To you, a job well done is enough reward in itself.

### Pilot
Your ship and you are as one. At the helm, you feel complete freedom and a righteous Iconic presence. You are never more alive than when you pierce the Uharan clouds, when you soar across the Kuan jungles, or when you defy death by diving into an asteroid field. Flying is living, and you want to live more than ever.

### Preacher
You are convinced that the Third Horizon is the promised land of the Icons – and it is your duty to convince its people of this. You are a preacher, a bringer of holy words, one of the Icons’ countless pilgrims. Humility, duty and piety are your virtues. In times like these, when the Dark between the Stars grows stronger, you are needed more than ever.

### Scientist
The Horizon is full of mysteries, but they can all be explained. You are a soldier in the service of science, your duty is to find answers where others see only questions. You work tirelessly, honoring the scientific method, testing and re-testing your hypotheses. There are no absolute truths, only a constantly changing canon of stories about the creation of the Icons. It’s your job to write those stories.

### Ship Worker
You have always felt the stars calling to you. Your destiny is to travel the endless Darkness with your crew. Your ship is your home and your best friend, and you know her like the back of your hand. You live a tough life in a tough profession but you wouldn’t trade it for anything – you are a starfarer through and through.

### Soldier
You know what war and violence do to people. You have seen it up close. Watching your friend being blown to bits does something to your soul, alters your mind. What you also know is that a Vulcan carbine is power in its absolute form. Violence is power. You don’t live for killing, but as  
long as the factions keep fighting, as long  as the corsairs keep raiding and as long  as someone pays and feeds you, you will continue doing it. Because you are a soldier, and it’s just what you do.

### Trailblazer
Curiosity is your poison. You have always been one to look under every stone, search every nook and cranny. Your calling is to unravel the Horizon’s secrets and mysteries. You know that the future can be told through the ruins of the past. If you only dig deep enough and work hard enough, maybe you will be the one who discovers a secret so vast it will shake the Horizon to its very core.
